# [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)

* A greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.  
Find a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.

### Procedure
1. Select a start vertex.
1. Turn the 'Selected' flag.
1. Insert a paired data into a Priority Queue.  
    The paired data is constructed (w, u), w for the weight of the edge and u for the dst vertex.  
    The pairs are sorted in increasing order of weight in the priority queue and if the weights are equal, then sorted in increasing order of vertex numbers.
1. Then greedy looks at the pair from the top of the priority queue, so that the weight w is minimal.  
At this time, if u, the end point of the edge has not yet been selected, pop the pair from the priority queue.  
This is a way to prevent cycles.
1. If (w, u) is a valid pair, the weight w is added to the sum of the costs of the MST and u is marked as selected.  
Also, look at each edge u->v adjacent to u and its weight w', and insert a pair (w', v) into the priority queue if the endpoint v is not yet selected.
1. Repeat 4, 5 until the priority queue is empty.

The length of the code is almost the same as that of the Kruskal algorithm.  
The execution time is the same as O(processing each edge once * cost of inserting/deleting in the priority queue) = O(E * logE) = O(ElogV)
